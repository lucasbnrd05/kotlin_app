## Description
**IMCTrack** is an Android mobile application designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide personalized health tips based on the results. The app offers users a simple and intuitive interface to track their BMI over time, helping them monitor their progress and maintain a healthy lifestyle. With features such as progress history and tailored advice, **IMCTrack** serves as a practical tool for anyone looking to understand and improve their body health.

### Environmental Impact & Justification
IMCTrack is not just a tool for tracking health; it also promotes environmental awareness and sustainability. By encouraging users to engage in physical activity outdoors, the application indirectly contributes to improving air quality and reducing respiratory health risks. Access to a map showing outdoor sports locations helps users find green spaces, parks, and fitness areas, reinforcing the importance of maintaining and protecting natural environments in urban settings.

Furthermore, the food scanner feature plays a role in promoting responsible consumption by allowing users to make informed dietary choices. By understanding the nutritional composition of food, users can reduce waste and support more sustainable food practices. This, in turn, helps mitigate food shortages and biodiversity loss by encouraging a balanced diet and responsible resource use.

The application also incorporates an environmental education aspect by integrating personalized health objectives that align with sustainable living habits. Encouraging regular exercise and outdoor activities reduces sedentary behaviors, indirectly fostering better adaptation to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and pollution spikes. Additionally, the ability to locate natural water sources, such as fountains and canals, further enhances the userâ€™s connection to a healthier, greener environment.

By providing users with tools to monitor their progress and set fitness goals, IMCTrack fosters a proactive approach to well-being that aligns with ecological sustainability. The integration of location-based services ensures that users can find the best places to exercise while contributing to the broader conversation about urban renaturalization and the importance of preserving open natural spaces.
